This repository demonstrates an uncommon CSS bug related to the `calc()` function and potential selector problems. The `bug.css` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.css` provides the corrected version.  The issue highlights how certain browser inconsistencies or selector mismatches can lead to unexpected layout behaviors when using `calc()` with percentage and pixel values.  The solution offers a revised approach that resolves these problems and ensures more reliable CSS behavior.
